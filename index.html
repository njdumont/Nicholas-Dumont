                    A little about me. I am currently a senior studying finance and math at Arizona State University, originally from Philadelphia. As a former computer science student, I have a substantial technical background, evidenced by my strong quantitative skills in areas such as financial modeling and data analysis. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid golfer and enjoy playing tennis and basketball. My passion for sports is complemented by a deep interest in history, which I love to explore through reading. I believe my well-rounded profile combines rigorous academic training with diverse extracurricular activities, making me a dynamic and versatile individual ready to excel in the finance industry.
